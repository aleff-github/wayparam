# License

wayparam is intended to be released under the **GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3)** (recommended: `GPL-3.0-or-later`).

## Inspiration notice

This project is **inspired by ParamSpider**: it targets the same high-level objective (collect archived URLs from Wayback/CDX, filter noise, and focus on parameterized endpoints), but it is a rewrite with a different internal architecture.

## Make the repository consistent

When publishing under GPLv3, ensure:
- `LICENSE` contains the GPLv3 text (or references a `COPYING` file with the full text)
- `pyproject.toml` matches the chosen SPDX form (`GPL-3.0-or-later` or `GPL-3.0-only`)
- README and manpage mention GPLv3
- source files include SPDX headers (recommended):
  - `# SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later`

## Third-party notices

If any code or snippets were incorporated from other projects (including MIT-licensed sources), keep the required attribution and license text in a `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` file.
